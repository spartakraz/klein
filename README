ABOUT
-----

KLEIN is a small and simple single-file C program which implements a
minimalist 64-bit text editor for the Linux terminal. Though its original purpose is 
to edit small shell script files, you can use it for editing small
source code and configuration files as well. The editor allows you to test your  
scripts right from within its environment.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

KLEIN's dependencies are few - libc and curses libraries, namely 
their glibc and ncurses implementations respectively. By default 
the ncurses library is statically linked to the program at the stage of 
compilation so you do not need to install the library separately on your machine.
 
INSTALLATION
------------

Change to the directory with the program's source files and run 'make' to
build the program's executable file. Then run 'make install' as root
to install it to /usr/bin directory of your machine. If you want to uninstall
the program just run 'make uninstall' as root.
 
STARTING KLEIN
--------------

Run the program from the command line as: 'klein <filename>', where <filename>
is name of the file to open. If you do not specify the filename 
the program will not start. You can view the program's help using 'klein -h'
command. To view the program's version run the 'klein -v' command.
 
DEVELOPMENT
-----------

KLEIN is written in the C programming language using gcc, glibc and ncurses.
The development is done under the Debian operating system (version 9.4, 64 bit).

FEATURES
--------

At the current stage of development, KLEIN is excessively simple and 
offers only minimal, the most essential functionality. It offers
very limited customization options and among others lacks such useful 
features as regex search and syntax highlighting.
